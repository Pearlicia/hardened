. How will you test the changes? The changes will be tested in a non-production environment such as a test cluster.
. How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster? The changes should be tested in a non-production   cluster. Once the change is applied, we should monitor metrics using our observability and monitoring techniques like  	Prometheus and Grafana.
. Can the change be canary tested with some traffic directed to simulate load on the system? It's not possible to simulate directing traffic easily to a non-production cluster.
. What is the environment? The environment is a non-production cluster.
. Does the environment mimic production? If not how can we mimic production? Our environment mimics production as it's a verbatim configuration.
. Can the change be safely rolled back? Editing the cluster.yaml should be version-controlled with Git so the change can be rolled back. However, as a reboot is required, it's not trivial to do quickly.
